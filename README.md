8. The county with the highest turnout.

## CHALLENGE RESULTS
- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
  - There were 369,711 votes cast in the election
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct:
  - Jefferson County received 10.5% of the total votes (38,819 votes)
  - Denver County received 82.8% of the total votes (306,121 votes)
  - Arapahoe County received 6.7% of the total votes (24,771 votes)
- The largest county turnout for the election was:
  - Denver County receiving 82.8% of the total votes with 306,121 votes.
- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% of votes (85,213 votes)
  - Diana DeGette: 73.8% of votes (272,892 votes)
  - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% of votes (11,606 votes)
- The winner of the election was:
  - Diana DeGette with 73.8% of the total votes with 272,892 votes.

## CHALLENGE SUMMARY
- This script is incredibly versatile and can be scaled upwards or downwards depending on the scenario and data that you are looking for.  Instead of calculating votes of counties in a local election, this script can be upscaled to calculate the total votes of states in national elections.  This script can als be used to downscale the other way and calculate vote counts of specific neighborhood or ballot cast locations within a county.
